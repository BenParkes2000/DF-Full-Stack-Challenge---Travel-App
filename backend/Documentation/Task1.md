### Introduction

Initially, the web application relied heavily upon the devices local storage to fulfil its functionality. However this restricted it in its customisation limitations as well as with security. By implementing a back-end service we can fix some of these issues and make the overall experiences for users more enjoyable.

### Problems that the backend service will solve

Initially by having the favourite locations stored on the users local storage, it means that between different devices there may be differences in the data (favourite locations) and you would have to manually change these values on all devices if you wanted to add / remove just one location.

By introducing a backend service, we can have a login service which will help prevent access to unauthorised people. This would be more integral when storing more sensitive user information (such as passwords rather than just favourite locations from the front end)

### Benefits that the backend services will bring to the user

By having a user's favourite locations saved to their user profile within the database, it will allow easier access to these locations from separate devices. As a result, it will save them time and make their experience with the app smoother as they will not have to change their preferences on every device if they change them on one device.

Using a backend database means that only by having the correct email and password a person may be able to access the sensitive information about someone from the app. Being able to change your password from within the app helps improve the security of a user's account knowing they can change it from within the app.

### Impact that the backend services will have on the customer's business

By having an experience that can be personalised easily, it will make customers prefer to use it (in comparison to one that doesn't allow this), increasing customer activity with the app making them more likely to use other DF Corp Apps due to them seeing the brand as reliable.

The implementation of user authentication help improve security and builds trust betweeen the user and the app/business as they know their data is safe and is not at risk of a data breach.
