### <h1>Task 4</h1>

Due to the weather app already providing details about the weather and surrounding hotels, the app may make use of using a flight data API.
From this API the user would be able to check flight costs, the status of flights, as well as booking/ cancelling flights within the app.
Additionally, the DF bank app may be able to be integrated. Having easier access to financial details, will make people's experience with the app smoother as they will not need to swap between apps to check things such as date of transactions (in relation to booked flights / hotels).

This would increase customer engagement with the app as it would save them going to another app to complete these tasks if they were to go abroad. Additionally, it may bring other customers in who are using the flight API to use other parts of the application such as finding out the weather.

To implement this, we would need an API key such as from https://aviationstack.com/. This could be implemented into a new page with links from other pages changing to it whilst filling out relevant data related to flights.
